## Who I am
Are you passionate about leveraging the power of data science to create business strategy, drive user engagement, and make financial impact? If so, we have something in common! 

I am a seasoned data science professional with 8+ years of experience in digital media and marketing analytics for healthcare and insurance industries. I help companies solve complex business problems and make data-driven decisions through A/B/multivariate testing, statistics, and machine learning. Examples from my achievements include:

 - Successfully launched a pioneering care management lite program to 200K Medicare plan users, driving 35% behavior change and 10K incremental compliances in health screenings
 - Built and deployed a multi-class neural network model to optimize the targeting of digital campaigns and achieve $5-7.5M of incremental medical cost savings
 - Standardized experimentation framework and leveraged causal inference methodologies to improve the accuracy of program impact by 30%

## What I'm up to...
- Iâ€™m constantly learning, currently focusing on causal inference with machine learning and Python
- My next learning goal is to understand the basics of GenAI and MLOps
- I'd like to expand my industry knowledge in product analytics and user growth strategies as well
