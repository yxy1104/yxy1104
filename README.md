## Who I am
With 8 years of experience as a Data Scientist, I'm passionate about driving business impact through technical solutions. My expertise spans ML algorithms, experiment design/evaluation, and quantifying business impacts. Proficient in SQL (HiveQL, MySQL, MSSQL), Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and more), and R (dplyr, data.table, ggplot2, and others), as well as big data platforms (Hive/Hadoop, GCP), I have the technical capabilities to tackle challenging problems.

Beyond technical capabilities, I possess strong business acumen and communication skills, enabling effective collaboration with stakeholders. I am good at breaking down abstract problems into actionable steps and creating pragmatic work plans. I've successfully built and led high-performing data science teams, fostering a culture of success and delivering impactful presentations to senior leadership for data-driven decisions.
